You don&rsquo;t need any external resources at all. This plugin will only takes your `editor.min.js` and `mte.min.js` file from your `manager\assets\sword\editor` folder to be applied in your public comment form.

Upload the `comment-editor` folder along with its contents through the plugin uploader. You need to compress the folder into a ZIP file to simplify the uploading process. After that, go to the plugin manager page and follow the instructions on the **About** tab.
